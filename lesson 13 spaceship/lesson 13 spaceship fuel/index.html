// 1. Write a function greenEnergy() that has an object as a parameter and sets that object’s 'Fuel Type' property to 'avocado oil'.

// 2. Write a function remotelyDisable() that has an object as a parameter and sets (or reassigns) that object’s disabled property to true.

// 3. Call your two functions with the spaceship object in the code editor, then console.log() the spaceship object to confirm those properties were changed/added.

let spaceship = {
    'Fuel Type' : 'Turbo Fuel',
    homePlanet : 'Earth'
